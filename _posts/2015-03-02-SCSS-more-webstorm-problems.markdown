Today started off with more permission problems with my files which were easly fixed this time but then webstorm decided that it wanted to install a plug in that compressed a compressed file so that confused the browser and just shutdown the whole page. Its fixed now I dont know how but im not questioning it at all just letting it do its thing.

{% highlight ruby %}
Webstorm...
{% endhighlight %}

WOW that cool
